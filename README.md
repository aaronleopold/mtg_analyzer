# MTG Deck Analyzer

A program to run analyses on MTG decks by simulating beginning game draws / mulligans and rating each run.

## Usage (Development)

```bash
$ cd mtg_benchmarker
$ cargo build
$ cargo run --release
```

Running rust library manually will eventually just run the tests written for the benchmarking implementation
